// Issue #761: the server exited with the attached client after answering a
// pane query.
//
// Every console injection ends with FreeConsole and, when the process had a
// console before, AttachConsole(ATTACH_PARENT_PROCESS).  The server is started
// with CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE, so it always "had" one, and the first injection
// moved it into the console of its parent: the client that cold started it.
// Over ssh that console belongs to the channel, so closing the connection sent
// CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT to the server along with the client.
//
// The runtime proof is tests/test_issue761_server_console_detach.ps1.  These
// guards keep the two halves of the fix from coming apart: every re-attach in
// the injection code goes through the one helper that consults the server
// flag, and the server entry point sets that flag.
