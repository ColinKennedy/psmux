// Unit tests for the spare shell pool: depth accounting, refill scheduling
// arithmetic, and the `warm-pool-size` option.
//
// The bug these pin: the pool used to be a bare `Option<WarmPane>`, a depth of
// one. Claim the single spare, refill, and the refill is a shell that started
// milliseconds ago -- so the NEXT creation claims a newborn and pays its whole
// startup. Sequential creations therefore alternated fast, slow, fast, slow.
//
// What is testable without a real shell is the accounting that drives it:
// `deficit()` (how many spawns the loop should hand to the background spawner
// this tick, counting the ones already in flight), FIFO claim order, and the
// option that sets the target. The end to end timings live in
// tests/test_pane_startup_perf.ps1, which asserts p90, max and bimodality.
