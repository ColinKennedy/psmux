// #759 follow up: the session's name has to ride on EVERY frame an attached
// client receives. The dump-state reply carried it since issue #7 batch D, but
// the server's push path builds the frame separately and left it out, and an
// attached client takes most of its frames from the push. Its `[#S]` status,
// `command-prompt -I '#S'` and the rename overlay's fallback then kept the port
// file base (`ns__name`) for the life of the client, and a rename-session made
// anywhere else never reached it.
