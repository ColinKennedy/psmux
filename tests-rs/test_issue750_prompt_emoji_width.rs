// Issue #750: a prompt counted its text one character at a time, where the
// pane's grid counts a variation selector sequence as one two column cell
// (#533). The two disagreed inside one psmux, and the cursor landed on top of
// the next character.
//
// GROUND TRUTH for the sequence this fixes: eight terminals, measured by
// writing it with WriteConsoleW and reading how far the console's own cursor
// advanced. Windows Terminal, VS Code, JetBrains, conhost, WezTerm, Alacritty,
// mintty and ConEmu all give `U+2764 U+FE0F` TWO columns, and `U+2764` alone
// one. tmux 3.7c gives it two as well (`#{cursor_x}` after a write), with
// `variation-selector-always-wide` on by default.
//
// What this does NOT decide is a cluster joined across characters that carry a
// width of their own, a skin tone modifier or a ZWJ sequence. The grid keeps
// those as separate cells, terminals disagree about them, and the prompt
// follows the grid rather than taking a side.
