//! Issue #659 follow up: a pool respawn must also refuse the spares that were
//! still being spawned when it was requested.
//!
//! `WarmPaneSync::Respawn` is what a warm claim applies after adopting the
//! claiming client's environment (#659), and what a `default-shell` change, a
//! client resize and a host colour change apply. `kill_all` only reaches the
//! spares already in the pool. A refill issued before the respawn captured the
//! old environment block the moment its `CreateProcessW` began and lands in
//! the pool afterwards, and `new-window` hands it out.
//!
//! Measured with `tests/test_issue659_warm_claim_environment.ps1`: a standby
//! trickles its pool one spare at a time after its boot hold, each spawn 75 to
//! 270 ms inside `CreateProcessW`, and a claim arriving inside that window gave
//! the next window the standby's environment in 3 of 10 runs on dd695eaf.
//!
//! Every spare issued so far carries an id below `next_pane_id`, so raising
//! the pool's issued floor there makes `WarmPool::push` refuse each late
//! arrival, the gate a cold creation already uses (ebce952).
